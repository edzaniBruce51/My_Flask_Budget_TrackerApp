DJANGO TO FLASK MIGRATION - SIMPLE GUIDE
==========================================

This document explains how we migrated the Finance Tracker app from Django to Flask in simple terms.

WHAT WE DID
-----------

1. REPLACED DEPENDENCIES
   - Removed Django packages
   - Added Flask packages (flask, flask-sqlalchemy, flask-login, flask-wtf)

2. CREATED BASIC FLASK FILES
   - app.py: The main file that starts the application
   - models.py: Contains database tables definitions
   - forms.py: Contains form definitions for user input
   - routes.py: Contains all the website paths/URLs

3. CONVERTED DATABASE MODELS
   - Changed Django models to SQLAlchemy models
   - Kept the same tables: User, Category, Budget, Expense
   - Kept the same relationships between tables

4. CONVERTED USER LOGIN SYSTEM
   - Switched from Django's built-in auth to Flask-Login
   - Created login, logout, and registration pages

5. CONVERTED TEMPLATES
   - Moved templates from Django syntax to Jinja2 (Flask's template system)
   - Kept the same look and feel
   - Updated template tags ({% url %} to {{ url_for() }}, etc.)

6. KEPT STATIC FILES
   - Kept the same JavaScript for charts
   - Kept the same CSS styles

7. CREATED DATABASE SETUP
   - Added init_db.py to initialize the database
   - Added sample data for testing

8. REMOVED DEPLOYMENT CODE
   - Removed code specific to production deployment
   - Removed Django admin interface

HOW TO RUN THE NEW APP
----------------------

1. Install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Initialize the database:
   python init_db.py

3. Start the application:
   python app.py

4. Open your browser and go to:
   http://localhost:5000

5. Login with demo account:
   Username: demo
   Password: demo123

WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW
--------------------

1. SIMPLER STRUCTURE
   - Fewer files to manage
   - More straightforward organization

2. NO ADMIN INTERFACE
   - Removed Django's built-in admin site
   - Focus on user-facing features only

3. DIFFERENT DATABASE ACCESS
   - Using SQLAlchemy instead of Django ORM
   - Same data, different way to access it

4. EASIER LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
   - No need to run migrations
   - Simpler to start and stop the application

The application works the same way as before - you can still:
- Track expenses
- Manage budgets
- View spending by category
- See charts and reports

All user data works exactly the same, just with Flask handling things behind the scenes instead of Django.
